# hello-world
what the fuck am I doing here I don't know but I really just want to work and make money from home so here I am with a new avenue
I'm a mother 2, soon to be 3, my husband is determined to work at home and smoke bud all day, so here I fucking am trying to make his dreams come true. Can't I just take a nap and work a normal job?




What's the point of tedium of this? Showing me the ropes, gotcha. I really am learning the site, when's the last time I had to do that. Yesterday and all weekend long, this cryptocoin adventure is interesting.
